👤 Who is Tayfun?

Hi, I’m Tayfun.

I’m a builder working at the intersection of AI and Web3, developing open-source projects that aim to make contribution, privacy, and intelligence verifiable on-chain.

Through projects like IQON, Privora, and ArcVault, I’ve built systems that make contributions provable, AI outputs confidential yet verifiable, and individual effort transparent on the blockchain.

Each project carries a unique value proposition.
My goal is to turn those values into accessible, open systems for everyone.

“My only goal: Transparent contribution. Real value. Quiet execution.”
